This encompasses operations of a service queue.

//Resume Website

I made this website back in 2019 to showcase my experience in html/css.
It gets updated every now and then whenever I get a new job, learning new skills, etc.
Currently I have no domain set up, but in the future it will get set up.

//File Compressor (the util.h and secretmessage.txt.huf)

The program's objective is to take in a text file and compress its contents with huffman encoding, which is a process commonly used for lossless compression.
It outputs the same .txt file but with the extension .huf, as shown in secretmessage.txt.huf.
The same program also decompresses/decodes .huf files.
